## by (Ugwuonah Faustina)


## Dataset

> This dataset contains information on loan disbursement activities by prosper loan agency over from 2005 to 2014. There are 113,066 different loans that have been acquired from prosper loan agency and 15 columns holding information on the borrowers such as occupation of borrower, state of residence (borrowerstate), and reason for taking out the loan (category). Before data exploration, necessary libraries were imported, the file was read in, unnecessary columns were dropped, all spaces in column headers were replaced with " _ " and the necessary column headers were renamed. The column containing date was then changed to datetime and the time attached to it was removed, duplicates were dropped, numbers after the decimal point in the monthly income column were sliced off and then a copy of the dataset was created for the exploration. All these wrangling steps were tested for.

## Summary of Findings

> After visualizations, It was discovered that the demographic most beneficial to the company are borrowers mostly students in California who take out loans of 5000 dollars and below. This is because a greater percent of their customer base were mostly residents of California and the student communities wherein majority was recorded to take loans below 5000 dollars. California could also have more clients a result of more efficient marketing protocols put in place and the fact that it could be the headquaters of the company, hence existing for longer than other branch offices. California is also the state with the highest loans issued, closely followed by Texas and Florida. The company was seen to be in the beginning stages in the year 2006 as that was one of the lowest profit yielding years on record. This was not the case for too long as the company quickly grew in profit and by the year 2008, the company saw the first of peak profit on record. 2009 and 2010 were also quite similar as profits were up to 0.35% reached. However, for a majority of the states, profits began to drop from the more recent years of 2011 to 2014. The cause of this drop was attributed to the size of loans that were issued in the more recent years (2011-2014) as it was seen that the amount issued out in loans began to increase in these years. The loan amount that produced the most yield was 5000 dollars and below and when loan amount was compared to yield, loans less than or equal to 5000 dollars were found to yield a lot more than loans greater than 5000. This is believed to be the reason why 2014 had the least yield after 2006. To increse yield, it would be advisable for more efficient marketing strategies to be devised such as the one used in California and targeted to directed at all occupations especially student and homemaker populations. It would also be advisable that smaller loans be issued out more than bigger loans in general.


## Key Insights for Presentation

>I analysed for three insights in my notebook. However, in line with the instructions for the presentation, I chose to present two features of interest; The demographic that is most beneficial to the company and the loan amount that produces the most yield. A reduction in profit was observed in the most recent years recorded. In order to inform the loan agency on how to increasing their profit, these insights were considered. I will start the introduction with the loan that produces the most yield. I will present the distribution of loan amounts disbursed and then the hexbin comparison between loan amounts issued and yield. 
After this I will present the most beneficial demographic beginning with the distributions of employment status, borrower's states, their occupations, and the reason they need the loan, then the highest yielding states, and then the most profitable states and year.
